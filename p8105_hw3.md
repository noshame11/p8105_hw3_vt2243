Problem 1

``` r
brfss_data_2002 =
  filter(brfss_data, year == "2002") %>%
  distinct(state, county) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  filter(n == 7)
## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?
brfss_data_2002
```

In 2002, the following states had 7 locations:

``` r
## Spaghetti Plots
brfss_plot = 
  brfss_data %>%
  distinct(year, state, county) %>%
  select(year, state, county) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  mutate(count = n())
ggplot(brfss_plot, aes(x = year, y = count, color = state)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Making Table
------------

``` r
brfss_table = 
  brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010)
```
