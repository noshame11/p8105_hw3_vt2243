Problem 1

``` r
brfss_data_2002 =
  filter(brfss_data, year == "2002") %>%
  distinct(state, county) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  filter(n == 7)
## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?
brfss_data_2002
```

In 2002, the following states had 7 locations:

``` r
## Spaghetti Plots
brfss_plot = 
  brfss_data %>%
  distinct(year, state, county) %>%
  select(year, state, county) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  mutate(count = n())
ggplot(brfss_plot, aes(x = year, y = count, color = state)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Making Table
------------

``` r
brfss_table =   
  brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == '2002' | year == '2006' | year == '2010') %>%
  filter(state == 'NY') %>%
  filter(response == 'Excellent') %>%
  mutate(data_value_numeric = as.numeric(data_value)) %>%
  summarize(brfss_excellentsd = sd(data_value_numeric), brfss_excellentmean = mean(data_value_numeric))
brfss_table
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   brfss_excellentsd brfss_excellentmean
    ##               <dbl>               <dbl>
    ## 1              3.77                23.0
